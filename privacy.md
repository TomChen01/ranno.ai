# Ranno.ai Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 31, 2025**

At Ranno.ai, your privacy is paramount. We are committed to creating a running route planner that is not only smart and safe but also respects and protects your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your data when you use Ranno.ai.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

Ranno.ai is designed with privacy at its core, leveraging on-device AI to minimize data collection.

* **User Input (Natural Language Queries):** When you use Ranno.ai, you provide natural language requests (e.g., "I want to run 5km in San Francisco, flat and safe"). This input is processed **locally on your device** by Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano) to understand your intent. **These queries are not sent to our servers or stored by Ranno.ai in any personally identifiable way.**

* **Location Data (Approximate/Contextual):** To provide relevant route suggestions, you may specify a general location (e.g., "near Golden Gate Park" or "starting from my hotel"). This location context is used solely for generating your route within the Google Maps API. **Ranno.ai does not track your real-time GPS location, nor do we store your specific geographic coordinates on our servers.** All location processing related to route generation occurs transiently.

* **Non-Personalized Usage Data:** We may collect anonymized, aggregated usage data (e.g., number of routes generated, features accessed) to understand general user behavior, improve our application, and identify potential issues. This data **cannot be used to identify you personally**.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The limited information we collect is used exclusively to:

* **Generate Personalized Running Routes:** Your natural language requests and contextual location data are used by our AI and mapping APIs to create routes tailored to your specific preferences and safety needs.
* **Improve Ranno.ai:** Aggregated, anonymized usage data helps us understand feature popularity and areas for enhancement, leading to a better user experience.
* **Ensure Safety:** Crime and amenity data are integrated into the routing algorithm to provide safer and more convenient routes. This data is not linked to individual users.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

Ranno.ai is built on a foundation of data minimization and privacy.

* **No Sale of Personal Data:** Ranno.ai **does not sell, rent, or share any personal information** with third parties for their marketing purposes.
* **Third-Party Services:**
    * **Google Maps JavaScript API:** Your route requests (which may contain general location context) are sent to Google Maps for map rendering and route calculation. Google's Privacy Policy governs their use of this data.
    * **San Francisco Crime Data API / Amenities Data API:** We access publicly available, anonymized data from these APIs to inform route safety and amenity suggestions. No personal user data is shared with these services.
* **Legal Compliance:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal processes or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ranno.ai, its users, or the public.

## 4. On-Device AI & Your Privacy

A core tenet of Ranno.ai is the use of Chrome's **Prompt API powered by Gemini Nano**. This means:

* **Local Processing:** Your natural language input is processed directly on your device by the AI model. This significantly enhances privacy as your requests **do not leave your device** to be sent to remote cloud servers for AI inference.
* **Reduced Data Transfer:** By keeping AI processing local, we minimize the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the internet, further protecting your privacy and potentially reducing latency.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures designed to protect the information we collect. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our systems.

## 6. Your Choices & Rights

As Ranno.ai collects minimal personal information, your primary choices relate to your use of the application:

* **Input Control:** You choose what information to provide in your natural language requests.
* **Application Use:** You can stop using Ranno.ai at any time.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
