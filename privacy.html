    <h1>Ranno.ai Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: October 31, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>
      At Ranno.ai, your privacy is paramount. We are committed to creating a running route planner that is not only smart and safe but also respects and protects your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your data when you use Ranno.ai.

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Ranno.ai is designed with privacy at its core, leveraging on-device AI to minimize data collection.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Input (Natural Language Queries):</strong> Your natural language requests are processed locally on your device by Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano). They are not stored or sent to Ranno.ai servers in a personally identifiable way.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data (Approximate/Contextual):</strong> You may specify general locations for routing. We do not track your real-time GPS or store coordinates; processing is transient and scoped to Google Maps API usage.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Personalized Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymized, aggregated metrics (e.g., feature usage counts) to improve the product. This data cannot identify individual users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate personalized running routes tailored to your requests.</li>
      <li>Improve Ranno.ai via aggregated analytics.</li>
      <li>Integrate safety and amenity data to offer safer, more convenient routes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell or rent personal information.</li>
      <li>Route requests go to Google Maps APIs (subject to Google's privacy policy).</li>
      <li>We access public crime/amenity data APIs without sharing personal data.</li>
      <li>Information may be disclosed only when required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. On-Device AI &amp; Your Privacy</h2>
    <p>Gemini Nano runs locally via Chromeâ€™s Prompt API, so your requests stay on-device, reducing data transfer and enhancing privacy.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We apply reasonable safeguards but cannot guarantee absolute security of systems.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Control what you input into the app.</li>
      <li>Stop using Ranno.ai at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy periodically. Updates will appear here with a revised effective date.</p>
